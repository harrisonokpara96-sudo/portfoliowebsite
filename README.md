# portfoliowebsite
This is my personal portfolio website built with HTML5 and CSS3. The site includes four pages: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact Me.

## Features

- Responsive design using fluid layout and media queries
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- Form validation
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Linear gradient backgrounds

## Viewport Dimensions

I used the following breakpoints for responsive design:

- **Mobile**: 480px and below
- **Tablet**: 481px to 768px
- **Laptop/Desktop**: 769px and above

These dimensions were chosen based on common device sizes to ensure optimal viewing experience across different screens.

## Linear Gradients

I used linear gradients in the following areas:

1. **Header**: A linear gradient from #4b6cb7 to #182848 (right direction)
2. **Body Background**: A 135-degree angle linear gradient from #f5f7fa to #c3cfe2
3. **Footer**: A linear gradient from #182848 to #4b6cb7 (right direction)

## Color Scheme

The color scheme was created using Adobe Color and includes:
- Primary: #4b6cb7 (blue)
- Secondary: #182848 (dark blue)
- Background: #f5f7fa to #c3cfe2 (gradient)
- Text: #333 (dark gray)

## External Code

No external code was used in this project. All code was written from scratch based on knowledge from course lectures.

## Validation

All HTML, CSS, and links have been validated using W3C validation services. The site has also been tested for accessibility using WAVE.

## GitHub Repository

The repository is structured as follows:
- index.html (main HTML file)
- styles.css (main CSS file)
- script.js (JavaScript functionality)
- README.md (this file)

The site is deployed on GitHub Pages at: []
